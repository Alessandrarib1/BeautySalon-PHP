LogiValidation file --> moved to a case inside of the controller. it was in view before.
same thing for the logOutFile and editAppointment

* it is not displaying my appointments

*AppointmentCOntroller line 42
login controller line 10



//in many files I call modal from the view
//in the router the display pages should call the controller first
//in the router I have some functions calling the controller to display some pages, but the interaction is only between the
//controller and view, it does not go into other layers. Ex: $adminController->DisplayRegisterUserPage();
//router,  case "/editAppointment" : line 97
                           require_once("../Controller/AppointmentController.php");
                           $appointmentController = new AppointmentController();
         It calls the controller, which calls the view (the view is only validating the data and calling back the controller)
  //case editAppointmentView need to be fixed

*error REGISTER USER


// when click on edit appointment, if u click in update appointment button without doing anything it takes u to a different
page and no feedback. It only happens for cases where the appointment was made without filling all fields.
//when registering new users no feedback message

* messy display
